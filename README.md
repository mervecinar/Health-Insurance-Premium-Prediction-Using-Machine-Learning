# Health-Insurance-Premium-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts health insurance premiums using machine learning. Accurate premium calculation is crucial for insurers and policyholders. Using data like age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, and region, we apply Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest models to forecast charges and analyze key factors.
